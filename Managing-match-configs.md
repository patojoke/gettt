The match config is described in the readme: https://github.com/splewis/get5#match-schema

This page aims to give advice on managing these config files.

## Managing team data 

One strategy for storing all the team data is to create a config for each team, then you can use the "fromfile" field when creating match configs.

For example:
Your match config, ``match.cfg``:
```
```

``team_nip.cfg``:
```
```

``team_nv.cfg``:
```
```
