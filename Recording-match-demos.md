### Enabling demos

By default, get5 will record a demo for each game. To do this, you need to enable GOTV on your server. Typically, that is done by adding ``tv_enable 1`` into your server.cfg file. Generally, that is the only action required to get a demo to be recorded.

Once a match starts, the server will issue a ``tv_record`` command with a file based on the value of ``get5_demo_name_format``. This cvar defaults to ``{MATCHID}_map{MAPNUMBER}_{MAPNAME}``. For example, the demo might look something like: ``3_map1_de_dust2.dem``.
 

### Disabling demos

Setting ``get5_demo_name_format`` to `""` will disable demos.

### Where are the demos?

In the root `csgo` directory on the game server. All get5 is doing is issuing a ``tv_record`` command, so it's no different from manually running the command.

### Uploading match demo on game end

Currently, get5 doesn't do any automatic upload of the demo file. For now, if you are willing to write code, you can use the ``void Get5_OnDemoFinished(const char[] filename)`` forward to do anything you want with the demo file.
