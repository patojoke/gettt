This is meant to be a more comprehensive explanation of how to install than in the readme: https://github.com/splewis/get5#download-and-installation

Before you start, make sure the CS:GO server is not running.

#### 1. Install Metamod:Source
Download from http://www.sourcemm.net/downloads. Make sure you get the latest version and for your server's operating system. To install, just merge the download's ``addons`` directory with the ``csgo/addons`` directory on the server.

#### 2. Install Sourcemod 
Download from http://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php. Make sure you get the latest version and for your server's operating system. To install, just merge the ``addons`` and ``cfg`` directory with the ``addons`` and ``cfg`` directories in the server's root ``csgo`` directory.

You may want to add youself as sourcemod admin, see https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Adding_Admins_(SourceMod). Otherwise, get5 commands will have to be used via rcon or directly on the server.
